Currently the count of retrieving all mediaItem IDs is based on the number of pages loaded, which via the API is 100 items on each page. 
However, when I run it, the final count provided is 12,000 even though the actual count of items is 10,600.
So this initial count isn't an accurate reflection on the number of total items.
